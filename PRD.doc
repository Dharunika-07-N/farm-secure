16. Appendices
16.1 Glossary of Terms
Biosecurity: Management practices that reduce the risk of introduction and spread of disease agents; involves measures to keep diseases out (external biosecurity) and prevent spread within the farm (internal biosecurity).
Compartment: An animal subpopulation contained in one or more establishments under a common biosecurity management system with a distinct health status with respect to a specific disease or diseases for which required surveillance, control and biosecurity measures have been applied.
Disease-Free Compartment Recognition: Official certification that a defined animal subpopulation meets international standards for freedom from specific diseases, enabling preferential trade access.
Zoonotic Disease: An infectious disease that is transmitted between species from animals to humans (or vice versa).
Transboundary Animal Disease (TAD): Epidemic diseases that are highly contagious or transmissible and have the potential for very rapid spread, irrespective of national borders, causing serious socio-economic and possibly public health consequences.
Farm-level Biosecurity: The specific practices and protocols implemented at an individual farm to prevent disease entry and spread.
Extension Worker: Government or NGO staff who provide technical advice and support to farmers in the field.
16.2 Compliance Framework Reference
The platform will support compliance with the following frameworks (examples):

OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (for compartmentalization)
ISO 22000 (Food Safety Management)
GlobalG.A.P. certification standards
National Livestock Identification System (where applicable)

17. Conclusion and Next Steps
17.1 Summary
The Digital Farm Management Portal for Biosecurity represents a comprehensive solution to address critical gaps in biosecurity knowledge, implementation, and compliance among pig and poultry farmers. By leveraging mobile-first technology, multilingual content, and user-centered design, the platform will democratize access to essential biosecurity tools and information, particularly for smallholder farmers in resource-limited settings.
The platform's success will be measured not just by user adoption metrics, but by tangible improvements in farm-level biosecurity practices, reduction in disease outbreak incidence, and enhanced livelihoods for farming families. Through strategic partnerships with government agencies, veterinary professionals, NGOs, and agribusinesses, the platform aims to create a collaborative ecosystem that strengthens the entire livestock value chain.
